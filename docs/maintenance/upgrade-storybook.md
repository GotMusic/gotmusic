# üß© Storybook + Tailwind Version Upgrade Plan

**Issue Type:** Maintenance / Tech Debt  
**Status:** Scheduled for later  
**Target Window:** After Design System v2.0 stabilization  

---

## üìã Summary

We are currently running **Storybook 8.6.14** for compatibility with key addons (`@storybook/addon-essentials`, `@storybook/addon-a11y`, `@storybook/addon-links`) and using **Tailwind v4** for web.  

When the addon ecosystem for **Storybook 9.x+** stabilizes, we will perform a full upgrade across all web and mobile packages to regain access to the newer testing, performance, and documentation improvements.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Upgrade **Storybook 8.6.14 ‚Üí 9.1.x+**  
- Align all addons to the same version (`@storybook/addon-essentials`, `@storybook/addon-a11y`, `@storybook/addon-links`, etc.)  
- Verify **Tailwind v4** integration with Vite builder remains stable  
- Prepare **NativeWind (React Native)** for Tailwind v4 once official support is released
