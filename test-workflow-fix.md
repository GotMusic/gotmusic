# Test Workflow Permissions Fix

This is a test file to verify that the issue-close-comment workflow permissions fix is working correctly.

## What This Tests

- The `issue-close-comment.yml` workflow should now have proper permissions
- The workflow should not fail with 403 "Resource not accessible by integration" errors
- The workflow should handle errors gracefully without breaking CI

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is merged, the issue-close-comment workflow should:
1. ✅ Successfully post a comment on the linked issue
2. ✅ Not fail with permission errors
3. ✅ Not create a "red x" on main branch

## Test Details

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/issue-close-comment.yml`
- **Permissions Added**: `contents: read`
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch to prevent workflow failures
- **Test Date**: 2025-10-18
