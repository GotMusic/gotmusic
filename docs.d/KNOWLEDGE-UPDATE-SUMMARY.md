## 2025-10-16 - ULID IDs + Auto-Updating Timestamps

### 2025-10-16 - Implement ULID Generation and Drizzle .$onUpdate()

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `apps/web/src/lib/ulid.ts` â€” ULID utility functions
- `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/ulid.test.ts` â€” Unit tests for ULID
- `apps/web/scripts/migrate-to-ulid.ts` â€” Migration script for existing data
- `apps/web/src/server/db/schema.ts` â€” Added `.$onUpdate()` to `updatedAt`
- `apps/web/src/server/db/seed.ts` â€” Use deterministic ULIDs
- `apps/web/src/server/db/audit.ts` â€” Use `generateId()` for audit logs
- `apps/web/src/app/api/upload/notify/route.ts` â€” Use `generateId()` for file IDs
- `package.json`, `apps/web/package.json`, `yarn.lock` â€” Added `ulid@3.0.1`

**Changes:**
- Implemented ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) generation for all new database records (assets, asset_files, asset_audit)
- Added `.$onUpdate(() => new Date())` to `assets.updatedAt` column in Drizzle schema for automatic timestamp updates on every `.update()` call
- Created utility functions: `generateId()` for new records, `generateIdAtTime(timestamp)` for deterministic seeding, `isValidUlid(id)` for validation
- Updated seed data to use `generateIdAtTime()` with fixed timestamps for CI/E2E stability
- Provided migration script (`migrate-to-ulid.ts`) with dry-run mode to convert existing IDs (optional, not run by default)
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering ULID format validation, determinism, and sortability

**Reason:**
- **Better sortability:** ULIDs are lexicographically sortable by creation time, enabling chronological sorting by ID alone without joining `createdAt` columns
- **Database performance:** Time-ordered IDs improve B-tree index efficiency
- **Deterministic testing:** `generateIdAtTime()` enables repeatable, stable IDs for E2E tests and seed data
- **UUID compatibility:** ULIDs are 128-bit and URL-safe, maintaining compatibility with existing systems expecting UUID-like identifiers
- **Auto-updating timestamps:** Drizzle's `.$onUpdate()` ensures `updatedAt` is always accurate without manual intervention in every API route

**Related Issue:** Closes #64

- **Related issues:** Closes #128

  - Loading state announcements for screen readers
  - Proper link labels and button descriptions

**Guidelines for logging changes:**

1. **Log immediately after making changes** (while context is fresh)
2. **Be specific about what changed** (not just "updated doc X")
3. **Explain why** (helps future readers understand decisions)
4. **Link related issues** (enables traceability)
5. **Use reverse chronological order** (newest entries at top of each section)
6. **Group related changes** (if updating multiple docs for one logical change)
