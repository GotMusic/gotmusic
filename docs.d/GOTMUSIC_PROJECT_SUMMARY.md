## 2025-10-17 - Workflow & CI Optimization

### 2025-10-17 - Parallel-Start Workflow (Zero Wait Time)
- **Files updated:** `docs.d/AGENT-START.md`, `docs.d/ISSUE-PR-WORKFLOW.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Files created:** `docs.d/workflows/GIT-CONFIG-SPEEDUPS.md`
- **Change:**
  - **Workflow Paradigm Shift:** Start next issue IMMEDIATELY after PR merge (don't wait for automation)
  - **Sync-Before-PR:** Always run `git fetch && git rebase origin/main` before creating PR
  - **Timing Improvement:** Work time (10 mins) overlaps with automation time (1 min) = zero dead time
  - **Throughput Gain:** Complete ~20% more issues per session (no more 1-minute waits between issues)
  - **CI Optimizations:** 
    - Enabled `cancel-in-progress: true` (cancel stale runs)
    - Added Turbo cache (`.turbo` directory)
    - Added Next.js build cache (`apps/web/.next/cache`)
    - Added Playwright browser cache (`~/.cache/ms-playwright`)
    - Reduced timeouts: checks 15→10 min, build 30→20 min, e2e 25→20 min
    - Expected CI time: 2-4 minutes (down from 5+ minutes)
  - **Git Aliases:** Created `git start`, `git sync`, `git pushpr` shortcuts
  - **Documentation:** Comprehensive guide for Git speedups, worktrees, pre-push hooks
- **Agent Pattern:**
  1. PR merges → START immediately
  2. `git fetch origin && git switch -c feat/scope/desc-Y --no-track origin/main`
  3. Work locally (~10 mins)
  4. `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` (sync before PR)
  5. `git push -u origin feat/scope/desc-Y && gh pr create ...`
  6. Say: "PR #X merged ✅! Started Issue #Y immediately. Will sync before PR."
- **Reason:** Eliminate dead time between issues; maximize throughput; simplify workflow
- **Impact:** 
  - **Before:** 10 issues × 1 min wait = 10 mins wasted per session
  - **After:** Zero wait time = 10 more minutes of productive work
  - **Result:** Complete 2-3 more issues per hour-long session
- **Related:** Workflow guide (ISSUE-PR-WORKFLOW.md), Git config (GIT-CONFIG-SPEEDUPS.md)
- **PR:** N/A (infrastructure improvement, will commit as workflow upgrade)

## 2025-10-17 - Workflow: Auto-Merge CI Monitoring (Full Automation)

### 2025-10-17 - Add automatic CI monitoring and merge
- **Files created:**
  - `docs.d/workflows/AUTO-MERGE-PATTERN.md` - Full automation documentation
  - `docs.d/workflows/scripts/poll-and-merge.sh` - CI monitor that auto-merges when green
  - `docs.d/workflows/scripts/check-pr-failures.sh` - Pre-flight check for CI issues
- **Files updated:** `docs.d/AGENT-START.md`, `docs.d/ISSUE-PR-WORKFLOW.md`
- **Problem:** Agent had to wait for manual "CI passed" notification before merging
- **Solution:** Background monitors poll CI every 30s, auto-merge when all checks pass
- **Workflow:**
  1. Create PR → Start monitor in background (non-blocking)
  2. IMMEDIATELY start next issue (don't wait!)
  3. Work on next issue while previous PR's CI runs
  4. Monitor auto-merges when CI passes
  5. Repeat infinitely
- **Benefits:**
  - ✅ Zero wait time between issues
  - ✅ True parallel development (work on multiple issues simultaneously)
  - ✅ Fully hands-off (no manual merge commands)
  - ✅ Auto-detection of CI failures
  - ✅ ~40% faster throughput (work while CI runs)
- **Monitor features:**
  - Polls every 30 seconds
  - Max wait: 20 minutes
  - Auto-merges + deletes branch when green
  - Logs failures to `/tmp/pr-{num}-failure.txt`
  - Detects merge conflicts
  - Non-blocking (runs in background)
- **Safety:** Pre-flight check before starting new issues stops work if failures detected
- **Impact:** Enables unlimited parallel issues - agent never waits for CI
- **Related:** Completes the parallel-start workflow optimization

---

## 2025-10-17 - Workflow: Always Start from Main

### 2025-10-17 - Add "Start from main" requirement to prevent conflicts
- **Files updated:** `docs.d/AGENT-START.md`, `docs.d/ISSUE-PR-WORKFLOW.md`
- **Root Cause:** PR #219 was created while on PR #218's branch, causing merge conflicts
- **Problem:** When starting a new branch from another feature branch:
  - New branch inherits all commits from the old branch
  - When old PR merges, those commits are duplicated
  - Result: `CONFLICTING` merge state, requires rebase and force-push
- **Fix:** Added **Step 0** to workflow:
  ```bash
  # ALWAYS before creating new branch:
  git switch main
  git pull origin main
  # THEN create new branch:
  git fetch origin && git switch -c <branch> --no-track origin/main
  ```
- **Why `--no-track origin/main` matters:**
  - Creates branch from `origin/main` (remote), not local `main`
  - Ensures absolute latest code
  - Prevents inheriting commits from feature branches
- **Impact:** Prevents merge conflicts when parallel PRs merge in sequence
- **Lesson:** "Parallel-Start" only works when **every** branch starts from `main`
- **Related issues:** Learned from PR #219 merge conflict after PR #218 merged

## 2025-10-17 - Workflow: CI Error Handling Protocol

### 2025-10-17 - Add CI failure handling to agent workflow
- **Files updated:** `docs.d/AGENT-START.md`, `docs.d/ISSUE-PR-WORKFLOW.md`
- **Change:**
  - Added comprehensive CI error handling protocol (Step 8 in AGENT-START.md)
  - 10-step process: Stop → Switch → Analyze → Fix → Test → Push → Wait → Continue
  - Added "NEVER" list: don't move forward with failing CI, don't ignore errors
  - Added pre-flight check: verify previous PR CI status before starting new issue
  - Documented error handling in ISSUE-PR-WORKFLOW.md "Error Handling (CI Failures)" section
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Build: `yarn workspace @gotmusic/web build`
  - Lint: `yarn biome check .`
  - Typecheck: `yarn typecheck`
- **Purpose:** Prevent cascading errors and catch issues early
- **Reason:** Issue #198 had build failure that was initially missed; need protocol to handle CI failures immediately
- **Impact:** Ensures all PRs are green before moving forward; prevents dependent PRs from failing
- **Related issues:** Learned from PR #218 (Issue #198) build failure

  - Inserts `uploadJob` row (stage: done, message: "Upload completed successfully")
  - Returns `{ ok: true, assetId }` to client
  - Added 13 comprehensive integration tests covering validation, edge cases, and happy paths
  - **Schema fix:** Added `durationSec`, `fileCid`, `storageKey`, `ownerId` columns to `assets` table
- **Validation:**
  - Rejects missing required fields (400 status)
  - Validates durationSec must be positive integer
  - Supports optional title field (defaults to "Recording")
- **Testing:**
  - Tests missing fields, invalid types, boundary cases (1 sec, 1 hour recordings)
  - Tests multiple uploads for same user

## 2025-10-16 - ULID IDs + Auto-Updating Timestamps

### 2025-10-16 - Implement ULID Generation and Drizzle .$onUpdate()

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `apps/web/src/lib/ulid.ts` — ULID utility functions
- `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/ulid.test.ts` — Unit tests for ULID
- `apps/web/scripts/migrate-to-ulid.ts` — Migration script for existing data
- `apps/web/src/server/db/schema.ts` — Added `.$onUpdate()` to `updatedAt`
- `apps/web/src/server/db/seed.ts` — Use deterministic ULIDs
- `apps/web/src/server/db/audit.ts` — Use `generateId()` for audit logs
- `apps/web/src/app/api/upload/notify/route.ts` — Use `generateId()` for file IDs
- `package.json`, `apps/web/package.json`, `yarn.lock` — Added `ulid@3.0.1`

**Changes:**
- Implemented ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) generation for all new database records (assets, asset_files, asset_audit)
- Added `.$onUpdate(() => new Date())` to `assets.updatedAt` column in Drizzle schema for automatic timestamp updates on every `.update()` call
- Created utility functions: `generateId()` for new records, `generateIdAtTime(timestamp)` for deterministic seeding, `isValidUlid(id)` for validation
- Updated seed data to use `generateIdAtTime()` with fixed timestamps for CI/E2E stability
- Provided migration script (`migrate-to-ulid.ts`) with dry-run mode to convert existing IDs (optional, not run by default)
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering ULID format validation, determinism, and sortability

**Reason:**
- **Better sortability:** ULIDs are lexicographically sortable by creation time, enabling chronological sorting by ID alone without joining `createdAt` columns
- **Database performance:** Time-ordered IDs improve B-tree index efficiency
- **Deterministic testing:** `generateIdAtTime()` enables repeatable, stable IDs for E2E tests and seed data
- **UUID compatibility:** ULIDs are 128-bit and URL-safe, maintaining compatibility with existing systems expecting UUID-like identifiers
- **Auto-updating timestamps:** Drizzle's `.$onUpdate()` ensures `updatedAt` is always accurate without manual intervention in every API route

**Related Issue:** Closes #64

This checklist's "Next Sprint" section (10.5) is **automatically updated** via GitHub Actions when issues are closed, reopened, or labeled. The workflow runs `scripts/sync-execution-checklist.mjs` which syncs with actual GitHub Issues state.

**Manual sync:** `node scripts/sync-execution-checklist.mjs`

### ⚡ Workflow Timing (Modified Sequential)
- **CI Duration:** 3-5 minutes (build + E2E tests)
- **Automation Duration:** ~1 minute after merge (sync-checklist workflow)
- **Recommended Pattern:**
  1. Work on ONE issue fully (branch → commit → PR → push)
  2. While CI runs (~5 mins), READ and PLAN the next issue (but don't create branch yet)
  3. Once PR merges + automation completes (~2-3 mins), START the next issue
  4. **Why?** Parallel branches create merge conflicts. Sequential work with planning during CI = no conflicts + minimal dead time.

---

## 1) Environment & Secrets
- [ ] `.env.example` contains *all* required variables (no secrets)
- [ ] Root README includes an **Env Table** explaining each variable
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` added with **Secrets policy** and **No-Secrets-in-Commits** rule
- [ ] Optional: gitleaks/secretlint CI job enabled

**Required variables (examples)**
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` (Base Sepolia)
- [ ] `EAS_RPC_URL`, `EAS_SCHEMA_UID_LICENSE`
- [ ] `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY`
- [ ] `LIT_NETWORK` (`datil-test`) and `LIT_ACTION_ID_LICENSE_CHECK`
- [ ] `NEXUS_API_URL` (Avail Nexus), `NEXUS_API_KEY` (if issued)
- [ ] `BLOCKSCOUT_BASE_URL` (Base testnet)

## 2) EAS — License Receipt Path (Day 1)
- [ ] Write schema **LicenseReceipt** (buyer, seller, assetId, price, currency, txHash, cid, termsHash)
- [ ] Register schema on **Base Sepolia** → capture `SCHEMA_UID`
- [ ] Implement `packages/api/easWriter.ts`:
  - [ ] `createLicenseReceipt(params): Promise<{ uid }>`
  - [ ] Network/provider config pulled from env
- [ ] CLI sample: `yarn demo:attest:license ...` returns UID
- [ ] Docs: update `docs.d/attestations/eas-schemas.md` with fields + UID
- [ ] README: add the **Blockscout** link format for attestation UIDs
- [ ] Tests: mock provider + verify field mapping

## 3) Lighthouse + Encryption (Day 2)
- [ ] `packages/crypto/encrypt.ts` (AES-GCM) with:
  - [ ] Random 256-bit key generated per asset
  - [ ] IV per-file (not reused), auth tag handling
  - [ ] KDF for envelope if needed
- [ ] `packages/api/lighthouse.ts`:
  - [ ] `encryptAndUpload(filePath): Promise<{ cid, keyEnvelope }>`
  - [ ] Return CID and *do not* log raw keys
- [ ] CLI: `yarn demo:encrypt-upload ./samples/kick.wav` → CID prints
- [ ] Docs: `docs.d/operations/lighthouse.md` (limits, retries, pinning behavior)
- [ ] Tests: encrypt→decrypt roundtrip on small buffer

## 4) Lit Protocol ACC (Day 2)
- [ ] Lit Action `license-check.js` (network: `datil-test`)
  - [ ] Inputs: buyer, assetId
  - [ ] On-chain check: LicenseReceipt exists for (buyer, assetId)
  - [ ] Output: `{ authorized: boolean }`
- [ ] Client wrapper: `packages/api/lit.ts`:
  - [ ] `checkLicense(buyer, assetId)` calls Lit Action & parses result
- [ ] Unit test: authorized path (mock EAS ok), unauthorized path
- [ ] Fallback flag: `GM_FEATURE_LIT=false` → deterministic local policy used

## 5) Payments — Avail Nexus Bridge & Execute (Days 3–4)
- [ ] Deploy a **dummy receiver contract** on Base Sepolia (no-op function)
  - [ ] Contract address recorded in README
- [ ] Implement `packages/api/avail.ts`:
  - [ ] `createIntentPYUSD({ amount, buyer, destContract, data })`
  - [ ] `submitIntent(...)` returns **tracking id** + eventual **txHash**
- [ ] Web hook/polling or event stream to capture **tx success**
- [ ] Fallback A: If Nexus credits pending → do **same-chain** PYUSD (or USDTEST) transfer on Base Sepolia
- [ ] Fallback B: If PYUSD not deployed on testnet → deploy ERC-20 mock `USDTEST` with 6 decimals
- [ ] On success: call EAS writer to mint LicenseReceipt (with `txHash`)
- [ ] UI: show **tx hash**, **Open in Blockscout** link

## 5.5) Infrastructure Complete ✅

  - [ ] EAS UID visible
  - [ ] **Open in Blockscout** for tx + attestation
- [ ] **Download & Decrypt** button:
  - [ ] Calls Lit ACC

  - [ ] If unauthorized → clear UX message + retry

**Common**
- [x] Dark theme (Tailwind + design tokens)
- [ ] Light theme variant
- [ ] Keyboard/Focus states accessible
- [ ] Error boundaries/logging (Sentry-ready hook, even if DSN unset)

### 6.1) Home — **Brands & APIs** Section ✅ **COMPLETED**
> Add a showcase section **below "How It Works"** that lists our core brands/integrations (onchain, storage, wallets, infra). Pure presentation; safe while E2E is bypassed.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Section renders on `/` **below How It Works**
- [x] Uses accessible **tabs** (role="tablist") for categories: `On-chain`, `Storage`, `Wallets`, `Infrastructure`
- [x] Responsive grid: 2 cols (sm), 3 (md), 4 (lg+)
- [x] Each logo has meaningful `alt`, parent has `aria-labelledby`
- [x] Reduced motion respected; no marquee/animations required
- [x] Falls back to text tiles if logo asset missing
- [x] No external network calls (static data only)

**Implementation tasks**
- [x] `apps/web/src/data/brands.ts` — static catalog:
  - `{ name, category, href, logo: '/brands/<slug>.svg', description }`
- [x] `apps/web/src/components/home/BrandsAndApis.tsx`
  - Accessible tabs + grid; keyboard nav; focus states
  - Optional badge tinting by category via tokens
- [x] Wire to page: `apps/web/src/app/(shop)/page.tsx` (render after How It Works)
- [x] Assets: add temporary SVGs to `apps/web/public/brands/` (placeholders OK)
- [x] Optional Storybook: `BrandsAndApis.stories.tsx` (visual diff aid)
- [x] Optional smoke test (non-blocking while E2E disabled):
  - Assert section heading visible + tab switch renders items

**Out of scope (follow-ups)**
- Replace placeholders with licensed official SVGs
- Auto-hide entries behind feature flags (e.g., `GM_FEATURE_LIT`, `GM_FEATURE_NEXUS`)
- Dynamic availability badges (online/offline ping)

## 7) Mobile UX — Happy Path (Days 5–7)
**Preview**
- [x] Screen: simple list from `/api/assets`
- [x] 30s preview plays with expo-av
- [x] Audio mode configuration for mobile
- [x] Respects platform audio settings

**Library**
- [x] Library screen with owned assets (stub data)
- [x] Asset cards with purchase details and metadata
- [x] Navigation with expo-router
- [ ] Manual "Sync Purchases" (enter or scan buyer address)
- [ ] Shows owned asset(s) if attested (EAS integration)
- [ ] **Decrypt & Play**:
  - [ ] Biometric prompt (or PIN fallback)
  - [ ] Secure-store for wrapped key envelope
  - [ ] Full track playback

**Polish**
- [x] Pull-to-refresh functionality
- [x] Empty state UI with call-to-action
- [x] Loading states
- [ ] Toasts for errors
- [ ] Link-out: **Open in Blockscout** from receipt row

## 8) CI & Tooling
- [x] Workflows:
  - [x] `ci.yml` → install (immutable), tokens build, lint (Biome), typecheck, build, e2e
  - [x] Yarn 4.3.1 + Corepack setup in all jobs
  - [x] PostgreSQL service container for E2E tests
  - [x] `commitlint.yml` → Conventional commits (lint-commits workflow)
  - [x] `label.yml` → Auto-label PRs based on changed files
  - [x] `issue-close-comment.yml` → Auto-comment on closed issues
  - [x] Cache: Yarn (.yarn/cache), Turbo, Build artifacts
- [x] Required checks on PR: `checks`, `build`, `e2e`, `lint-commits`, `label`
- [x] `yarn ci:local` script mirrors CI steps
- [x] Biome auto-format before check in CI
- [x] E2E tests: 7 Playwright tests + 15 API integration tests + 5 contract tests
- [x] **Readiness endpoint:** `/api/readiness` validates DB + migrations + seed data
- [x] **Playwright waits on readiness:** Prevents "page stuck" timeouts
- [x] **Deterministic seeds:** Fixed IDs/timestamps for stable assertions
- [x] **Contract tests:** Validate API JSON shape, types, enum values
- [x] **db:reset:ci script:** `yarn db:push && yarn db:seed`
- [ ] Size guard (optional): warn on bundle increases in apps/web

## 9) Security Baseline
- [x] No secrets in repo (scan passes)
- [ ] Encrypted assets only (no raw samples committed)
- [x] ACC is **deny by default**
- [ ] EAS writes record price & currency used
- [ ] Terms-of-use hash present in attestation (link terms PDF via Lighthouse)
- [x] Console logs scrubbed (no keys, no CIDs where not needed)

## 10) Accessibility (A11y) Essentials
- [ ] Keyboard-only nav (web)
- [ ] Contrast ≥ WCAG AA for primary/secondary text
- [ ] Focus visible on interactive elements
- [ ] Icons have `aria-label` or are `aria-hidden`
- [ ] Player controls reachable/tappable on mobile

## 10.4) Current Sprint Focus (Visual-First)

### **Web Development:**
- **Storybook** for component development and demos
- **Button/Card/Toast** components + Tokens Gallery
- **UI PRs must include:** Storybook screenshots

### **Mobile Development:**
- **Style Guide** screen with **Dev Panel** toggles
- **UI PRs must include:** Short screen recordings

### **Shared Infrastructure:**
- **Fixtures:** catalog items + receipts
- **Dev overlays:** 8-pt grid (web) + touch targets (mobile)
- **Design tokens:** Never hardcode colors/spacing/typography
